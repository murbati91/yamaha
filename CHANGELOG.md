### 📝 Implementation Guide

1. **Download Models:**
   ```bash
   # Example: Download boat model from Sketchfab
   # Save as: /public/models/boats/hook-32.glb
   ```

2. **Update Product:**
   ```javascript
   {
     id: 'hook32',
     name: 'Hook 32',
     modelPath: '/models/boats/hook-32.glb', // Add this line
     // ... rest of product data
   }
   ```

3. **Test:**
   - Open product configurator
   - 3D model loads automatically
   - Test color changes and rotation
